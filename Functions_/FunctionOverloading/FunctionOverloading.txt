OverLoading Functions : 

    * We can have functions that have different parameter lists that have the same name

    * Abstraction mechanism since we can just think 'print' for example

    * A type of polymorphism
        - We can have the same name work with different data types to execute similar behavior 

    * The comppiler must be able to tell the functions apart based on the parameter lists and argument supplied
