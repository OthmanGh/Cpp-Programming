Recursive Functions: 
    * A recursive function is a function that calls itself 
        - Either directly or indirectly through another function
    
    * Recursive problem solving
        - Base case
        - Divide the rest of problem into subproblem and do recursive call

    * There are many problems thaht lend themselves to recursive solutions 

    * Mathematic - factorial, Fibonacci, fractals

    * Searching and Sorting - binary search, search trees..
