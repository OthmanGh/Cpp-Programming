 Passing Arrays to Functions : 

    * We can pass an array to a function by providing square brackets in the formal parameter description
    
        void print(int numbers[]);

    * The array elements are NOT copied !!

    * Since the array name evaluates to the location of the array in memory - this address is what is copied

    * So the Function has no idea how many elements are in the array since all it knows is the location of the first element(the namem of the array)
