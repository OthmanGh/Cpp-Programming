How Do Functioon Calls Work? 

 1-Functions use the `function call stack`
    * Analogous to a stack of books
    * LIFO - Last In First Out
    * push and pop

 2-Stack Frame or Activation Record:
    * Functions must return control to function that called it 
    * Each time a function is called we create an new activation record and push it on stack
    * When a function terminates we pop the activation record and return 
    * Local variables and function parameters are allocated on the stack


__ Stack Size if Finite - Stack OverFlow can occur



NOTE : 
    * if recursion doesn't eventually stop you will have infinite recursion

    * Recursion can be resource intensive

    * Remember the base case(s)
        - it terminates the recursion

    * Only use recursive solutions when it make sense

    * Anything that can be done recursively can be done iteratively
